			<h1>Laravel 5.0 Application Structure</h1>
			
			<p>As most of the active Laravel followers know, new version (5.0) of this growing PHP framework is
			coming in the nearest future and even though it doesn't have any massive underlying shifts in its
			behavior, there's enough changes to warrant bump in the major version.</p>

			<p>In this blog I'd like to go over default application structure and give a short comment on every
			directory and file - what each does and what should be stored where. I will not go over various
			reasons for why new Laravel version has such changes, best person to ask that would be author of
			the framework - <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorotwell">Taylor Otwell</a>. All I have to say right now is that new
			structure definitely has its advantages that promote better workflow for medium to large applications.</p>
			
			<p>Keep in mind that at the time of the writing, L5 still wasn't released as beta or stable, so there might be some changes.</p>
			
			<h2>Root Directory</h2>

			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li id="readme-md"><strong><code>readme.md</code></strong> - General information about framework written in MarkDown, contains License, link to the documentation
				and some other bits of information.</li>
				
				<li id="phpunit-xml"><strong><code>phpunit.xml</code></strong> - This file contains configuration telling <a href="https://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a> testing framework
				how to run application tests - probably the most convenient way for you as a developer to write unit tests.</li>
				
				<li id="phpspec-yml"><strong><code>phpspec.yml</code></strong> - Similar to phpunit.xml, this file contains some configs used by <a href="`">PHPSpec</a> promoting code
				development via specifications.</li>
				
				<li id="package-json"><strong><code>package.json</code></strong> - This file contains configuration used by <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>.
				Node.js is a platform to run JavaScript on your server - great performance and huge number of awesome tools.
				This config file specifically will install <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp.js</a> and laravel-elixir tools.<br />
				Gulp.js - is a popular automated build tool. I will not go into details, but to put it simply it is a small command line tool, which would
				prepare various elements of the application (usually raw assets) for testing or production purposes.<br />
				Laravel-elixir is a tool built on top of the gulp.js. It is basically Laravel-specific build tool. More on tha could be found <a href="https://github.com/laravel/elixir">here</a>.
				</li>
				
				<li id="gulpfile-js"><strong><code>gulpfile.js</code></strong> - This is a config for Gulp.js build tool mentioned above. When executed via gulp
				this config will tell build system to create .CSS file from app.LESS file located in <code>resources/assets/less/</code> directory.</li>
				
				<li id="composer.json"><strong><code>composer.json</code></strong> - This should be familiar to anyone who used Laravel before. But in case if it's new for you -
				this is a config file for <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> dependency manager for PHP. It helps developers to load all
				the necessary libraries and tools required for development of the applications.</li>
				
				<li id="artisan"><strong><code>artisan</code></strong> - That is simply a PHP file without extension. It is being used to run various Laravel-related
				commands, such as generation of migration files, seeding database with new data, generation of auth files or tables
				in database and so on. For full list of commands you can run `php artisan` in the root of the application.</li>
				
				<li id="gitignore"><strong><code>.gitignore</code></strong> - Contains list of directories or files which <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a >. If you don't know
				what git is, I highly recommend learning it - it'll make you a better developer.</li>
				
				<li id=""gitattributes><strong><code>.gitattributes</code></strong> - Another git-related config file. Handles text normalization in git.</li>
				
				<li id="env-example"><strong><code>.env.example</code></strong> - This file is fairly important. This is an example file for environment configuration
				which is promoted way for you to handle sensitive configuration in Laravel.<br />
				When working on an application, you'd want to create .env file which will contain <code>KEY=VALUE</code> list of configuration
				variables such as database usernames, database passwords, social network tokens, secrets and so on. This .env file
				is explicitly set to be ignored in the mentioned above .gitignore file. What it means is that you as a developer can
				(and should) store sensitive information in this file, so that it won't be leaked when you publish your application on
				github or send to the customer or simply push to the main repository as a part of development team.<br />
				More on this in the future, meanwhile you can check google for other blogs describing this feature in more details.</li>

				<li id="tests"><strong><code>tests/</code></strong> - Here you'll put any test files written for your application. Nothing new here. Previously is
				has been located inside of the <code>app</code> directory.</li>
				
				<li id="storage"><strong><code>storage/</code></strong> - This directory contains <code>logs</code> directory where you'll go any time you need to check
				you logs, it also contains framework-specific dirs, where Laravel will store cached views, sessions and data if caching
				strategy in config is set to filesystem. Highly recommend checking this folder permissions - web server should have
				read/write rights for this directory and everything inside. Previously is has been located inside of the <code>app</code>
				directory. This trend will continue - a lot of directories previously located in the <code>app</code> were moved into the root.</li>
				
				<li id="resources"><strong><code>resources/</code></strong> - That directory is where you'll keep all of your applications-related resources.
				Namely: views (blade templates), language files and assets such as LESS/SCSS, JavaScript/CoffeeScrtip, sprites, maybe fonts
				and so on. Basically, it is encouraged to store your assets here and when application is ready for production, prepare your
				assets and move them to the public directory using mentioned above Gulp.js and Laravel Elixir (both are node.js modules).</li>
				
				<li id="public"><strong><code>public/</code></strong> - Pretty much standard directory which will face the internet. Usually, files in this directory will
				be always accessible to the user. Processed LESS/SCSS files, CoffeeScript and other assets located in the <code>resources</code>
				directory will be moved here when preparing application for production. Otherwise, you can create your own assets directory
				structure here and handle all of the static resources right away without the need to install node.js if you don't want to.</li>
				
				<li id="database"><strong><code>database/</code></strong> - This is another directory that was moved from the <code>app</code> directory. It contains
				<a href="http://laravel.com/docs/master/migrations">migrations and seeds</a> for your application. Besides location of the folder,
				nothing else is changed.</li>
				
				<li id="config"><strong><code>config/</code></strong> - Continuing trend with moving directories into the root. Again, this is the same folder with application-related
				configuration files for various libraries, services, databases and so on. It might be a good idea to check <code>database.php</code>
				file "mysql" section. Here you will notice following line <code>env('DB_HOST', 'localhost'),</code>. This is a new and encouraged
				way for you to handle sensitive data. <code>env()</code> function will look into the <code>.env</code> file if it exists and will
				try to fetch specified data by key (or fall back to the default - second argument). This will help you to keep passwords and
				tokens without possibility of exposing it to other people.</li>
				
				<li id="bootstrap"><strong><code>bootstrap/</code></strong> - This directory contains files that will autoload Laravel and all of the required libraries. In most
				cases you don't have to touch this folder at all.</li>
				
				<li id="app"><strong><code>app/</code></strong> - And finally - your application folder. In here you will store all of your application-related logic.
				Nothing but logic. As you can see, there's no configs, views or anything else. Because, as per L5 rationale - those are
				not our application in it's pure form.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>After you run `composer install` command you'll have  another directory - <code>vendor/</code> which will store all of the
			required libraries and Laravel framework itself.</p>
			
			<h2 id="app-dir">App Directory</h2>
				
			<p>Now, let's look inside of the app directory - it is quite different from the Laravel 4.x that you might be familiar with.</p>
				
			<ul class="unstyled">
			
				<li id="app-commands"><strong><code>app/Commands/</code></strong> - You might recognize this directory from L4.x version of the framework, but in new version
				it has a different purpose. In here you're supposed to store commands related to the Command Bus pattern. I won't go into
				the detail about that, all you need to know right now is that Command Bus provides a layer of separation between your application
				and framework + other external libraries. Plus it promotes reuse of application functionality. But, unless you're working on
				a more or less large-ish application it is doubtful that you would want to go with this additional level of complexity for small
				projects. For more info on commands you can check <a href="https://laracasts.com/lessons/laravel-5-commands">Taylor's video</a> or reddit
				for the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/29a6qz/what_am_i_missing_with_this_whole_command_bus/">discussion</a>.</li>
				
				<li id="app-console"><strong><code>app/Console/</code></strong> - And here's where our L4.x commands migrated. In here you'll find a <code>Kernel.php</code> file. This
				is where you’d want to register your newly created console commands. Then there's also a <code>Commands</code> directory. This
				is where Laravel will put command files after running <code>php artisan make:console</code>. If you've used console commands
				previously - workflow is quite similar.</li>
				
				<li id="app-"><strong><code>Events/</code></strong> - Quite a self-explanatory director. In here you're advised to put your Event files. Depending on the size
				of the application you might want to either keep files right in here or create more inner directories to separate events, so
				it would be easier to understand and name them.</li>
				
				<li id="app-eceptions"><strong><code>Exceptions/</code></strong> - Same as Events. Here you're advised to put your application-related Exceptions. You can find
				<code>Handler.php</code> file in here - any time you throw new exception it goes through this file (and it's parent class).
				What is does is basically tells how various exceptions should be handled - should some exception be logged or not, how to render
				thrown exception, which exceptions should not be reported.</li>
				
				<li id="app-handlers"><strong><code>Handlers</code></strong> - Another new directory and this one might be hard to grasp on first sight.<br />
				Classes located in <code>app/Commands/</code> and <code>app/Events</code> are not actual commands with logic in them
				(although, they do can contain it, but we'll skip this). Those classes actually would be so called Data Transfer Objects
				(DTO) - they exist as a wrapper for your data that is being passed between your Controller or Console and Command/Events
				Handlers. You're ought to store your business logic in these handlers which receive DTOs and use whatever data they transfer.
				As you can see - that adds quite a bit of complexity to your app, but at the same time this is one of the patterns that promotes
				Single Responsibility principle.<br />
				So, what that means that in <code>app/Commands</code> you will store your DTO classes and in <code>app/Handlers/Commands</code>
				you will have your handler containing your business logic.</li>
				
				<li id="app-http"><strong><code>Http/</code></strong> - This is where L4.x Controllers were moved and sprinkled with quite a number of goodies. In here you will
				have all of your logic related to HTTP requests handling. Just like Console directory handles command-line commands, this one
				will handle requests from the web.
				
					<ul class="unstyled">
						<li id="app-http-controllers"><strong><code>Http/Controllers/</code></strong> - Pretty much the same as in L4.x. You have your abstract <code>Controller.php</code> which
						is being extended by specific Controllers such as <code>HomeController.php</code> or <code>UserController.php</code>.
						For more complex apps you might want to add more directories in here for better separation of concerns between controllers.<br />
						In here you can also see <code>Auth</code> directory which contains two controllers that will handle user authentication and password
						reset out of the box.</li>
						
						<li id="app-http-middleware"><strong><code>app/Http/Middleware</code></strong> - New folder, new name, but that's actually something you should be familiar with.
						Middleware is a new name for filters. Out of the box it contains <code>Authenticate.php</code> middleware which checks
						where user is logged in and if not, redirects him to the login page. And the second is <code>RedirectIfAuthenticated</code>.
						What is does is redirects user to specified page ('/home') if user is logged in.
						If you have experience with node.js and express framework, this must look very similar.<br />
						Besides these two middleware classes framework has half a dozen of others, including CSRF check, middleware to encrypt cookies,
						middleware to start a session and so on, but those are hidden in the core of the framework.</li>
						
						<li id="app-http-requests"><strong><code>app/Http/Requests</code></strong> - And the last directory here. Requests directory is supposed to hold FormRequests - special
						type of classes that do validation of HTTP requests and specifically form data. I would advise checking google
						or <a href="https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-5/episodes/3">Laracasts</a> to find out in details what is
						Form Request. But in short - it is a class that will validate user input and depending on the result of validation,
						either returns user back to the page with the form and errors telling what's wrong or pass data to controller method
						that was originally requested.</li>
						
						<li id="app-http-kernel"><strong><code>app/Http/Kernel.php</code></strong> - This file contains couple of attributes. Namely an array of all middleware classes that
						are being run on each request. For example - VerifyCsrfToken middleware which will make sure that forms you submit are
						not being tampered with by malicious third party. To remove middleware you simply remove the line mentioning it.<br />
						Second parameter - <code>routeMiddleware</code>. That array contains named middleware which you might call in some routes,
						but not in the others.</li>
						
						<li id="app-http-routes-php"><strong><code>app/Http/routes.php</code></strong> - this is simply a file which will hold your application routes. It's almost completely
						the same as in L4.x - except for filters. Now, as mentioned before, they are called middleware.</li>
					</ul>
				
				</li>
				
				<li id="app-providers"><strong><code>app/Providers</code></strong> - This directory holds your application services - same classes as you might have seen in L4.x libraries.
				Each class here is responsible for booting certain part of the application.
				
					<ul class="unstyled">
						<li id="app-providers-app"><strong><code>app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.ph</code></strong> will instantiate an app itself and will map Auth-related package called Registrar
						to the correct contract.</li>
						
						<li id="app-providers-bus"><strong><code>app/Providers/BusServiceProvider.php</code></strong> is responsible for handling Command Bus dispatcher. It will also map
						<code>app/Commands</code> and <code>app/Handlers/Commands</code> directories so it'll be aware of the files inside them.</li>
						
						<li id="app-providers-config"><strong><code>app/Providers/ConfigServiceProvider.php</code></strong> this is going to be very important file pretty much for everybody. Laravel 5
							discarded previous system where packages could publish its config files into your app directory and provide default configuration
							that could be easily changed. That one is gone. What it means is each package should define it's configuration in its ServiceProvider
							file. Then you can access and extend this configuration in you ConfigServiceProvider.php. And after that package will access final
							extended configuration in its <code>register()</code> method. If anybody is interested - that could be a topic for another blog post.</li>
					</ul>
				
				</li>
				
				<li id="app-services"><strong><code>app/Services</code></strong> - In this directory you're encouraged to store your application-related Services.
				Services here work as a layer that contains your business logic - you might feel like that is the same thing as Commands do.
				Before, you might have used your services straight from the controller - and it is not incorrect, but in certain cases when application
				structure is sufficiently complex you might consider using Command Bus to dispatch one of the Commands (which are DTO as you may remember)
				which will be received by Command Handler. And only then, in the Command Handler you would call various Services and Events to handle received
				data. You might ask why. And the reason is separation - Use of Command Bus could help to handle requests from multiple sources
				without writing same code several times. But it comes at cost with a lot of boilerplate code. To be fair, I would not recommend
				going overboard with Commands unless you really know what you are doing and what you need. Services, bypassing Command Bus
				would be simpler to deal with and they would be as testable.</li>
				
				<li id="app-services-registrar"><strong><code>app/Services/Registrar.php</code></strong> - This is a registration service which could be an example of how you might write your
				small-scale application. It contains two methods - one to validate user input and the other is to create new User in your database.</li>
				
				<li id="app-user-php"><strong><code>app/User.php</code></strong> - Last file, folks. This is nothing more but a model that you should be familiar with if you've used
				Laravel 4.x before. For those who are new to the frameworks - this is you data persistence class. It stores information about user
				and could be used to fetch users from database of your choice.</li>
				
			</ul>
			
			<br />
			<p>And that is all about application structure.</p>
			
			<br />
			<p>Next blog will be describing often asked question of "where do I put that file?" and general application development workflow.</p>
